A robotic prosthetic made using Arduino and the same robot arm from my previous robot arm build.

Uses myoelectric sensors to detect transdermal electric signals that are indicative of muscle activity (as opposed to the previous version, which took input from flex sensors in a glove). This arm/technology could be used by limb-different individuals to control the movement of the arm by flexing the muscle of the forearm, or shoulder depending on the amount of arm remaining. 

Naturally a production version would use stronger and lighter materials than the balsa wood of this arm (likely 3D-printed materials like ABS or carbon fiber), for reliability and comfort of the user.
